# AWS Serverless Template

A small template to get started with AWS Lambda, the Serverless Framework & a minimalist Express app

## Assumptions

- Serverless framework is installed & configured https://serverless.com/
- Access to an active AWS account

## Setup guide

- Download or clone project & run NPM/Yarn install
- Update region in serverless.yml
- Build normal express app using the app.js
- Use index.js to deploy to AWS
- Use local.js to test locally without Serverless framework
